## Description
[Burger Logger](https://dry-anchorage-08139.herokuapp.com/) is a fun app to keep track of burgers that have been devoured and burgers that have yet to be devoured. This app is a simple representation of the usefulness of a model-view controller (MVC). The following were critical to the effectiveness of this app:
* JawsDB as the database
* Heroku to host the app
* An MVC structure
* Handlebars
* Node.JS
* Express
* Express-Handlebars
* MySQL
* An ORM
